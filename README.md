## About

This is my fork of the official [PDF Arranger](https://github.com/pdfarranger/pdfarranger)
*pdfarranger* is a small python-gtk application, which helps the user to merge
or split pdf documents and rotate, crop and rearrange their pages using an
interactive and intuitive graphical interface. It is a frontend for
[pikepdf](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf).

*pdfarranger* is a fork of Konstantinos Pouliosâ€™s pdfshuffler
